This the code for the paper [Nash Convergence of Mean-Based Learning Algorithms in First Price Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03906)

Run the following Matlab scripts to produce results corresponding to each experiment in the paper: 
* |M^1|=2, epsilon-Greedy (Figure 1 and 2 in the paper): `experiment_eps_greedy_M_2.m`
* |M^1|=2, MWU (Figure 3): `experiment_MWU_M_2.m`
* |M^1|=1, epsilon-Greedy (Figure 4): `experiment_eps_greedy_M_1.m`
* |M^1|=1, MWU (Figure 5): `experiment_MWU_M_1.m`
